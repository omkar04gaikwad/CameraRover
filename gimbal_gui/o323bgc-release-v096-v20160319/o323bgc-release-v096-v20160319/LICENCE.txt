The project called simply as STorM32-BGC consists of several parts, such as the STorM32-BGC controller
hardware, the o323bgc firmware, and the graphical user interface o323BGCTool. This licence covers the
terms of usage for the o323bgc firmware and the o323BGCTool graphical user interface. For the terms of
usage of other parts please consult the respective locations, in particular the project web page.

LICENCE/TERMS OF USAGE for o323bgc firmware:
--------------------------------------------
The o323BGC firmware is free (but not open source). Besides unlimited private use you are also granted
the permission to use it for commercial purposes under the condition that (1) you don’t modify the
firmware, e.g. remove or change copyright statements, (2) provide it for free, i.e. don’t charge any
explicit or implicit fees to your customers, and (3) correctly and clearly cite the origin of the firmware
and the project web page in any product documentation or web page.


LICENCE/TERMS OF USAGE for o323BGCTool graphical user interface:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The o323BGCTool software is open source (but see below). Besides unlimited private use you are also
granted the permission to use it for commercial purposes under the condition that (1) you don’t modify
the software, e.g. remove or change copyright statements, (2) provide it for free, i.e. don’t charge any
explicit or implicit fees to your customers, and (3) correctly and clearly cite the origin of the software
and the project web page in any product documentation or web page. 

Comment: The GUI software is based on libraries, which I am using since nearly 10 years and which I have
modified over time in several places I can’t remember anymore. Furthermore, it is written in Perl using
Win32::Gui, which is not maintained anymore. It would take me an enormous effort to build a working
distribution. I hence don’t publish the complete code but just the “master” perl source file, which
however contains all relevant code.
